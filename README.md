# Xumo for Channels

**Xumo for Channels** is a containerized service that automatically generates a live M3U playlist and XMLTV EPG feed for Xumo, ready to serve to IPTV clients or middleware such as NextPVR and Kodi.

It wraps a lightweight Flask + Gevent web server that immediately serves a status page and provides the generated files once ready. The Xumo playlist and EPG data are generated by an adapted version of the excellent open-source [`xumo-playlist-generator`](https://github.com/BuddyChewChew/xumo-playlist-generator) by **BuddyChewChew**.
